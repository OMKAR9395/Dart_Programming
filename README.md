		var can store any value but gets locked to that type after initialization
		var name = "Omkar";   // Dart infers it as a String
		int age = 25;         // Explicitly declaring an int
		double height = 5.9;  // Decimal values use double

		final is set only once at runtime.
		const is set at compile-time and cannot be changed.
